                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                    staff
                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                    team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                    tutorial
                    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                    offers.
                    100% recommend! ”
